# 📦 MontyMall

> **"In the Monty Hall problem, switching is the optimal strategy. In MontyMall, we switch to Java 21 & Cloud Native for optimal performance."**

A showcase project demonstrating a **modern, high-concurrency microservices architecture** built with logic-driven engineering.

This project represents a "Strategic Switch" in software architecture—applying modern Java standards and decision science to build a production-ready system from the ground up.

It serves as a concrete proof of my ability to solve real-world problems and apply high-quality engineering practices.
